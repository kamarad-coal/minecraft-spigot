## Supported Minecraft versions

Kamarad Coal tests & builds only the latest patch versions for each minor versions. However, you might find images for non-latest-patches, because at some point that version was the latest patch.

The following Minecraft versions are deployed on an day-to-day basis:

- `1.16.5`
- `1.16.4`
- `1.15.2`
- `1.14.4`
- `1.13.2`
- `1.12.2`
- `1.11.2`
- `1.10.2`
- `1.9.4`
- `1.8.8`

## Versioning

Spigot builds support multiple Minecraft versions for each Github tag. The format for container tags is the following:

```
kamaradcoal/minecraft-spigot:[minecraft_version]-[repo_tag]
```

For example, this is going to be the latest tag for Minecraft `1.16.5`:

```
kamaradcoal/minecraft-spigot:1.16.5-latest
```

### Version Specific Tags

For version-specific tags, you might use the following image and tag, `1.0.0` being the repo tag:

```
kamaradcoal/minecraft-spigot:1.16.5-1.0.0
```

### Minecraft Majors and Minor versions

You can also specify major repo versions, where `1.0` means `1.0.x`:

```
kamaradcoal/minecraft-spigot:1.16.5-1.0
```

You can also specify major.minor repo versions, where `1` means `1.x` (all 1.x versions):

```
kamaradcoal/minecraft-spigot:1.16.5-1
```

### Latest Tags

For latest tags, use `latest` instead any other version:

```
kamaradcoal/minecraft-spigot:1.16.5-latest
```

## Kubernetes Integration

Coming soon.
